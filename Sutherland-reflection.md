**- What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
The difference between fetch and and pull.

**- What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
I didn't get to the part about merge conflicts within the hour that my guide was there but finishing up the challenge on my own still gave me a much better understanding of merge conflicts. The difference between pull and fetch was also clarified. 

**- What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
Unfortunately, I didn't have a pair. But my guide was able to help me a lot with time boxing and shortcuts - my guide had many great suggestions to help make things faster and easier for me in the future. 

**- What still confuses you about Git?**
I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what happens during the fetch command but I'd appreciate a visualization.

**- How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
I definitely missed having a pair, but it was still a good experience that I learned from.
